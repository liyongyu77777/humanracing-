##overview
This project used random forests and gradient regression models Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks, 
that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning technique used for regression and classification problems. It builds a model in a stage-wise fashion and generalizes by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function
Since this is a project about predicting performance, the two models are more compatible
##feature
Utilizing the advantages of machine learning in performance evaluation provides significant support to human resources.
